# FlatBrowser
Gives a flat overview of a file hierarchy based on file extensions.

Users can create categories, which can contain folders and specific extensions of interest. All folders within the category are deep searched and return only files ending with the specific extensions. Further filtering is possible using the search text box and extension enabling in real-time.
